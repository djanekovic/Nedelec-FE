FEM assembly routines for Nedelec elements
==========================================

Code in this repository is heavily inspired by [1]. Assembly routines use
PETSc library as backend. To compile the code you need PETSc installed and
setup with Triangle/ctetgen.

Compiling
=========

To compile the code just run:

$ make

Make will generate ./bin/ folder with eddy executable. In order to run and
compile tests run:

$ make tests

Tests are located in ./bin/tests/ folder. Tests are currently tested only with
one process.
